# Supriya_Portfolio

Welcome to my data science portfolio! 

This portfolio contains a collection of projects that demonstrate my skills and experience in the field of data science. Each project focuses on different aspects of data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling.

# Project List
## [Project 1: COVID 19 Analysis: Project Overview](https://github.com/Dr-S-Das/displayprojects/blob/main/COVID%2019%20Analysis.ipynb)

**Description:** 
In this project, I analyzed the collected first 100 days COVID 19 spreading dataset across worldwide countries/ regions. 
1. Re-arranged the countries in order with the maximum infection rate.
2. Generated a Happiness Report based on the analysis of GDP per capita, Social support, Healthy life expectancy, Freedom to make life choices, Generosity, Perceptions of corruption for these countries.
3. Produced correlation diagrams and Regression plots to understand the correlation between these above-mentioned factors and the maximum rate of infection. 

**Technologies used:**
Python, numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib

## [Project 2: COVID 19 Analysis: Project Overview](https://github.com/Dr-S-Das/displayprojects/blob/main/Tumor%20Detection.ipynb)

**Description:** 
In this project, I analyzed a dataset of tumors with different characteristic features and then prepared a model for tumor detection. 
1. Grouped the columns based on 'mean', 'se' and 'worst' features of data.
2. A statistical summary for all the characteristic features of the types of tumors were made.
3. A data correlation table was prepared along with a heatmap for the correlation.
4. The entire dataset was splitted into a trained and a test dataset to design a model for tumor prediction.
5. Accuracy of the prediction model was tested using random forest classifier.

**Technologies used:**
Python, numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn
