# Supriya_Portfolio

Welcome to my data science portfolio! 

This portfolio contains a collection of projects that demonstrate my skills and experience in the field of data science. Each project focuses on different aspects of data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling.

# Project List
## [Project 1: COVID 19 Analysis: Project Overview](https://github.com/Dr-S-Das/displayprojects/blob/main/COVID%2019%20Analysis.ipynb)

**Description:** 
In this project, I analyzed the collected first 100 days COVID 19 spreading dataset across worldwide countries/ regions. 
1. Re-arranged the countries in order with the maximum infection rate.
2. Generated a Happiness Report based on the analysis of GDP per capita, Social support, Healthy life expectancy, Freedom to make life choices, Generosity, Perceptions of corruption for these countries.
3. Produced correlation diagrams and Regression plots to understand the correlation between these above-mentioned factors and the maximum rate of infection. 

**Technologies used:**
Python, numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib

## Project 2: Sentiment Analysis on Social Media Data

Description: This project involved analyzing sentiments expressed in social media data. I used natural language processing techniques to classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral, and performed sentiment analysis to gain insights from the data.
Technologies used: Python, NLTK, scikit-learn, pandas.
## Project 3: Predictive Maintenance for Industrial Equipment

Description: The objective of this project was to develop a predictive maintenance model for industrial equipment. I utilized sensor data from machinery to predict failures and recommend maintenance actions, helping to reduce downtime and improve operational efficiency.
Technologies used: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib.
